# Abstract Data Types (ADT)


Abstract Data Types (ADT) are a core concept in computer science, defining data structures by their behavior from the point of view of a user, rather than by their implementation. ADTs specify the operations that can be performed and the semantics of these operations.

This repository provides a detailed description of three fundamental ADTs: Queue, Stack, and Linked List.
