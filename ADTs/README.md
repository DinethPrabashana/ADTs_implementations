# Abstract Data Types (ADT)

## Introduction

Abstract Data Types (ADT) are a core concept in computer science, defining data structures by their behavior from the point of view of a user, rather than by their implementation. ADTs specify the operations that can be performed and the semantics of these operations.

This repository provides a detailed description of three fundamental ADTs: Queue, Stack, and Linked List.

## Queue ADT

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

### Operations
- **enqueue(item)**: Add an item to the rear of the queue.
- **dequeue()**: Remove and return the front item from the queue.
- **peek()**: Return the front item without removing it.
- **is_empty()**: Check if the queue is empty.
- **size()**: Return the number of items in the queue.

## Stack ADT

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

### Operations
- **push(item)**: Add an item to the top of the stack.
- **pop()**: Remove and return the top item from the stack.
- **peek()**: Return the top item without removing it.
- **is_empty()**: Check if the stack is empty.
- **size()**: Return the number of items in the stack.

## Linked List ADT

A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. It allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements.

### Operations
- **Insert an item at the beginning of the list.**
- **Insert an item at the end of the list.**
- **Insert at a given point.** 
- **Delete an item at the beginning of the list.**
- **Delete an item at the end of the list.**
- **Delete at a given point.** 
- **prints the list**
